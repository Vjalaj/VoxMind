## Week 1: Implement basic command parsing (simple keyword matching)

### What I did:
- I wrote some code but seeing the complexity of the code and my limited exposure to python I had to use AI tools where I prompted in various ways possible by explaining the desirable command parser.

### Resources/AI used:
- I completely used AI tools-- Comet, ChatGPT 5.2 & Gemini 3.0 pro

### Challenges faced:
- Being a beginner there were various challenges like limited knowledge of the programming language which I overcame with the help of AI

### Next steps:
- I have tested the code on my local machine (Windows). There are certain limitations of the program like Opening applications, turning volume up and down or accessing the start menu despite showing that it is responding. The only thing that currently works through the program is that searching for a query using the browser. So there are many aspects that need to be improved.
