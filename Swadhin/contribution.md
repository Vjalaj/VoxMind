## Week 1: Create Simple Response System

### What I did:
- Designed and implemented a basic rule-based response system.
- Created a structured function to handle user input and return predefined responses.
- Ensured the system handles unknown inputs gracefully with a fallback response.
- Tested the system with multiple sample inputs to verify accuracy.

### Resources / AI used:
- Python official documentation
- Basic NLP concepts
- ChatGPT (for logic validation and optimization ideas)

### Challenges faced:
- Mapping user inputs to correct responses efficiently.
- Handling unexpected or undefined user inputs.
- Solved this by using conditional logic and a default response mechanism.

### Next steps:
- Improve the system by adding keyword-based matching.
- Integrate basic NLP for smarter intent detection.
- Convert the response system into an API or chatbot interface.
